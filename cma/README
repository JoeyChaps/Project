This package builds, installs, cleans, and removes the Memory Allocation 
project using Automake. 

The following source files and documents from the repository are required:

	*	cma.c cma.h ma.c joe.c debug.h README configure.ac Makefile.am

To set up Automake for builds and installs, run the followin commands in order:

	*	autoscan
	* 	libtoolize
	*	autoconf
	*	aclocal
	*	automake --add-missing
	* 	autoconf
	* 	./configure		(see following note on optional prefix argument)

To specify the base directory from which to install the directory subtree,
run the config command with the following arguments:

	*	./configure --prefix=<base directory>

where <base directory> is a hard path to the location. Running configure 
without arguments installs the directory subtree at the default location, 
root's usr directory, and requires root user permissions.

Once the previous steps are completed, you may use the following commands:

	*	make			(with no arguments, builds the project)
	*	make install	(installs source files in the directory subtree)
	*	make clean		(removes local executables)
	* 	make uninstall	(uninstalls files from the directory subtree)
