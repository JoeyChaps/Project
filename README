This version of SCons is set up to build, install, and clean files in 
the memory allocation project. The following commands should be run 
from the directory containing the ma.c, cma.c, cma.h, and debug.h files. 
If this isn't the same directory where SCons is installed, include the 
path to the scons executable.

To build:

	*	scons build

	The build option appears to be just that -- optional. That is, running
	the scons command without any options appears to do the same thing as 
	running it with the build option. The executables will be built in either
	case.

To install:

	*	scons install --prefix=<base directory>

	to designate a directory tree for the install files. The directory 
	tree includes /usr/bin for executables, /usr/include/cma for header 
	files, and /usr/lib for shared libraries. Or run

	*	scons install 

	to let root be the base directory. (Must have administrative 
	permissions for this option.)

To clean:

	* 	scons -c


Notes:

Cleaning removes executable and object files from the base directory, but 
not install files from install directory subtree locations. Install files 
should be manually removed from these locations on an uninstall.

After the executable has been built, run the following command to update
the library path:

	* 	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
